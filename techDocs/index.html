                <p><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong> is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language
                    with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages,
                    many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
                    JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
                    imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.</p>

            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web
                    pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you
                    to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
                    scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
                    layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered
                    in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
                <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13502/cake.png">
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for
                        example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the
                        page.</li>
                    <li>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example
                        setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content,
                        control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but
                        it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple text label as an example.
                    We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:</p>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;Player 1: Chris&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:
                <code>p {
    font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    text-align: center;
    border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
    background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);
    color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
    box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 3px 10px;
    display: inline-block;
    cursor: pointer;
}</code>
                And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behaviour:
                <code>const para = document.querySelector('p');

para.addEventListener('click', updateName);

function updateName() {
    let name = prompt('Enter a new name');
    para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;
}</code>
                JavaScript can do a lot more than that — let's explore what in more detail.

        <section id='A_"hello_world"_example' class="main-section">
            <header>A "hello world" example</header>
            <article>
                <p>The above section might sound really exciting, and so it should — JavaScript is one of the most lively web technologies, and as you start to get good at using it, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
                <p>However, becoming comfortable with JavaScript is a little harder than becoming comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small and keep working in small consistent steps. To start, we'll show how to add some basic JavaScript to your page, creating a "hello world!" example (the standard in basic programming examples).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, go to your test site and create a new folder named 'scripts' (without the quotes). Then, within the new scripts folder you just created, create a new file called <span class="highlight">main.js</span >. Save it in your <span class="highlight">scripts</span > folder.</li>
                    <li>Next, in your <span class="highlight">index.html</span > file enter the following element on a new line just before the closing <span class="highlight">&lt;/body&gt;</span > tag: <code>&lt;script src="scripts/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>This is basically doing the same job as the &lt;/link&gt; element for CSS — it applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</li>
                    <li>Now add the following code to the <span class="highlight">main.js</span > file: <code>var myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');<br>myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';</code></li>
                    <li>inally, make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved, then load index.html in the browser. You should see something like the following: <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9543/hello-world.png"></li>
                </ol>

        <section id="Arrays" class="main-section">
            <header>Arrays</header>
            <article>
                <p>Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects that contain multiple values stored in a list. Array objects can be stored in variables and dealt with in much the same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can access each value inside the list individually, and do super useful and efficient things with the list, like loop through it and do the same thing to every value. Maybe we've got a series of product items and their prices stored in an array, and we want to loop through them all and print them out on an invoice, while totaling all the prices together and printing out the total price at the bottom.</p>
                <p>If we didn't have arrays, we'd have to store every item in a separate variable, then call the code that does the printing and adding separately for each item. This would be much longer to write out, less efficient, and more error-prone. If we had 10 items to add to the invoice it would be bad enough, but what about 100 items, or 1000? We'll return to this example later on in the article.</p>
                <p>As in previous articles, let's learn about the real basics of arrays by entering some examples into a JavaScript console. We've provided one below (you can also open this console in a separate tab or window, or use the browser developer console if you prefer).</p>
                <p>Often you'll be presented with some raw data contained in a big long string, and you might want to separate the useful items out into a more useful form and then do things to them, like display them in a data table. To do this, we can use the split() method. In its simplest form, this takes a single parameter, the character you want to separate the string at, and returns the substrings between the separator as items in an array.</p>

        <section id="if_..._else_statements" class="main-section">
            <header>if ... else statements</header>
            <article>
                <p>Let's look at by far the most common type of conditional statement you'll use in JavaScript — the humble <span class="highlight">if ... else</span> statement.</p>
                Basic <span class="highlight">if ... else</span> syntax looks like so in pseudocode: <code>if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}</code>
